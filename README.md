# PropertyFinder

This Application is based loosely on a [YouTube Series by David Battersby](https://youtu.be/qvGGz-2WHpU). I didn't love the tone of the series so after making it through the first 20 minutes or so, I just looked at the website it's based on and started working from there.

The Web App is based on [Domain](https://www.domain.com.au/)

## Requirements

Below I've defined what this mock application will need to do in order to be considered complete.

### Users Groups

There will be two types of users, buyers and owners.

#### Buyers

- Can view **Properties**
- Can indicate interest in a **property**
- Can contact (notify) an owner

### Owners

- Can create, read, update and delete their own **properties**
